# Design

## Platform
We design a central platform to do the distribution of the work, i.e. the user the consumer spent their tokens in the platform, and platform supply the llm api to the consumer.

### key managing
These it is essential that there is a program that is managing the key of each user. The remainder can be treated as the token they left.

### list of the service now
And this backend program need to supply how much service they are providing like open-ai 4o api, llm3 and so on.

And there should be a record of these supplier who supply specific service.

### distribution of work to different node. 



And these guy who is running the llm will be rewarded.
